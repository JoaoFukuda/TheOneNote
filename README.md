# The One Note

One note to rule them all

Read it [here](src/theonenote.md).

## What even is this?

The one note is a document which contains small but powerful notes of all things I find interesting and worthy taking note of.

It lists things from hacking websites, courses, interesting tools and version formatting, as well as interesting capabilities, commands and options of softwares that I am not that familiar with (or I am, but I don't quite rely on my brain to remember all of it).

tl/dr: It's a tl/dr of many of the programs I use.

## Navigate

To navigate, simply use the summary located at the beginning of the file (currently it only has the main topics of linux, hacking, and programming) or use the button on the top-left part of the document (works on github and gitlab) to jump to the headers scattered throughout the document.

## Makefile?

Yes, this has a makefile so that I can easily convert this program to HTML or PDF using `pandoc`. You can use it **or** you can simply use the markdown version located in `src/theonenote.md`. The choice is yours.
